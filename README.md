# ConnectWise PHP Client

PHP client for the ConnectWise API using the [ConnectWise PHP Library](https://git.spinen.net/libraries/connectwise-php-library), which was generated by the [ConnectWise PHP Generator](https://git.spinen.net/libraries/connectwise-php-generator).

This repository is a READ-ONLY subtree spit of the Generator package, so all of the test are in that project.  All of the work is done in that repository to allow testing the client &amp; library in the same project.  Please direct any issues/PR's to that project.

### Usage

To use the client, you new it up with the following array...

```php
        $config = [
            "connectwise" => [
                "host"     => "&lt;host.to.your.connectwise&gt;",
                "company"  => "&lt;company&gt;",
                "username" => "&lt;user&gt;",
                "password" => "&lt;password&gt;"
            ],
        ];
        
        $client = new  Spinen\ConnectWise\Client\Client($config);
```

All of the methods are added via the Signature Trait with the pattern of camelCase of the API name with the StudlyCase of the method name (i.e. memberApiFindMembers to get the FindMembers method on the MemberApi).

You can pass the parameters as an associative array to the call (i.e. $client-&gt;memberApiFindMembers(['limit' =&gt; 5] to limit the return data to only 5 members);
