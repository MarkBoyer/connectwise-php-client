# ConnectWise PHP Client

PHP client for the ConnectWise API using the [ConnectWise PHP Library](https://git.spinen.net/libraries/connectwise-php-library), which was generated by the [ConnectWise PHP Generator](https://git.spinen.net/libraries/connectwise-php-generator).

This repository is a READ-ONLY subtree spit of the Generator package, so all of the test are in that project.  All of the work is done in that repository to allow testing the client & library in the same project.  Please direct any issues/PR's to that project.

### Usage

To use the client, you new it up with the following array...

```php
        $config = [
            "connectwise" => [
                "host"     => "&lt;host.to.your.connectwise&gt;",
                "company"  => "&lt;company&gt;",
                "username" => "&lt;user&gt;",
                "password" => "&lt;password&gt;"
            ],
        ];
        
        $client = new  Spinen\ConnectWise\Client\Client($config);
```
